The initial challenge arises from a question about the distribution of pharmacies across different regions and communes of Chile.

There are two main topics that can be covered under this theme:

a) Analyzing the problem of areas where the reach can is minimal, considering that the population density is is higher than the number of availables pharmacies due to the vastness of the territory. 

b) Approaching it from a viewpoint as an opportunity to contribute and take advantage of a business niche in sectors where establishing this kind of establishment could be more efficient and effective.


Where is this information found?

The data is located in a government  public data repository, detailing  all the pharmacies (brand, ID, location, among other data). This information is up to date for 2024: https://datos.gob.cl/dataset/farmacias-en-chile. 

Due to an ongoing census, data up to 2017 was used to obtain the population info. This information is public, and is found in the Library of the National Congress: https://www.bcn.cl/portal/


After cleaning the datasets (for example removing columns for pharmacies IDs, which we are not going to use), the graph shows us (in a column chart) the 15 most important cases, from a REGIONAL point of view (considering 
point a) to a Communal topic (covering point b).
